D&D Initiativizer
written by Ava Beaver


This is a personal project of mine made with the goal of learning to make a web app with Django
and gaining practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


This application tracks the initiative, HP, and various notes about each creature in a D&D encounter.
The list of creatures automatically sorts when an initiative updates. Finally, there are "start"
and "next round" buttons which highlight which creature's turn it is.


Note: because the sorting is done through "bubbling up," more creatures creates a larger overhead.
This site is intended to be fast and light-weight with encounters with less than 50 creatures.

(Though if you are a DM making an encounter with more than 50 turns per round, time is something
you have a lot of :wink: )
